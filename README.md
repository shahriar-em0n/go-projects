Go Conditional File-Operation Program

This project is a simple Go CLI application demonstrating:

Taking user input

Converting and validating input

Using conditional statements (if-else)

Performing a file delete operation

Handling errors safely

How It Works

The program asks the user a question:
“Do you love me? (yes or no)”

If the user types yes:
The program prints a friendly message.

If the user types no:
The program attempts to delete a file named test.txt in the project directory.
If the file exists, it is deleted.
If not, the program shows an error message.

Purpose
